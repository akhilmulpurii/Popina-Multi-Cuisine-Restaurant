Requirements : XAMPP or any alternative stack application with php server & mysql support along with a decent internet

To Get Started :

Make Sure Apache is installed on port 80 and mysql is installed on 3306 or else they have to be changed in many php files.

STEP 1 : Extract the contents of the popina-restaurant.rar folder to your htdocs/ path.

STEP 2 : Start XAMPP/Apache & XAMPP/mysql and go to phpmyadmin and create a database "landing_page". ( Without Quotes )

STEP 3 : Go to import and select database.sql file and import the structure into landing_page database.

STEP 4 : Go to localhost/{ your path }/index.html to start the web application. Once started you will be directed to a login page.
